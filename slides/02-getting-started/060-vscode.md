###  Run the compiler in watch mode

Run the compiler continuously in watch mode.

1. Open your project in vscode
    * Can be done from the command line using `code .`
1. Remove the "HelloWorld.js" file.
1. Hit **ctrl+shift+b** (run build task)
1. Now choose "tsc: watch - tsconfig.json"
1. Confirm that the "HelloWorld.js" file is generated

Let's see how problems might look in vscode

1. Open "HelloWorld.ts"
1. Add an error to the file, save the file
1. Open the "Problems" using pane using **ctrl+shift+m**,
or by clicking on ![TypeScript problem status bar](/resources/typescript_problemstatusbar.png) <!-- .element class="img-in-text"-->
in the status bar
1. Confirm that the problem can be found and you can click on the link.

Run your application using vscode

1. Press **F1** and select "Debug: open launch.json"
1. Inspect the newly created ".vscode/launch.json" file
1. Alter the first object in the `"configurations"` array
    * Change `"program": "..."` to<br /> `"program": "${workspaceRoot}/HelloWorld.js"`
1. Press **F5** again

You can now use **F5** for debugging and **ctrl+F5** for running your application.

### Debug your application

1. Alter the file "tsconfig.json"
    * Set `"sourceMap"` to `true`
1. Open "HelloWorld.ts". Set a breakpoint <br />
![breakpoint example](resources/typescript-breakpoint.png) <!-- .element class="pin-height-100" -->
